This specific version consists of pre-extracted **video frames**, rather than raw video files. These frames are essentially individual images taken from various video clips, capturing different human actions.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   We focused on a reduced image size of **96x96 pixels**.\n",
        "*   Each 'video' in our training sequence consists of a fixed length of **8 frames**.\n",
        "*   We specifically selected **4 distinct action categories** from the much larger UCF101 dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) baseline** that focuses on individual frames.\n",
        "*   A **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network** that processes features extracted by a CNN to understand the temporal flow of actions.\n",
        "*   And finally, a **Hybrid CNN-LSTM model** that combines both spatial feature extraction and temporal sequence learning in a single, integrated architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to identify which of these approaches is most effective for this video action recognition task, laying the groundwork for more complex video analysis."

        "\n",
        "Let's start by looking at the evaluation results for our most advanced model, the CNN + LSTM Hybrid. This model combines the spatial feature extraction power of Convolutional Neural Networks with the temporal sequence understanding of Long Short-Term Memory networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see from the Classification Report below, the Hybrid model achieved an overall accuracy of **83%** on our test dataset. This is a strong performance, especially given our limited dataset size for this demonstration. Let's break it down further by action category:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **ApplyEyeMakeup:** The model performed exceptionally well here, with 100% recall (meaning it correctly identified all instances of 'ApplyEyeMakeup') and 73% precision. The lower precision suggests it sometimes misclassified other actions as 'ApplyEyeMakeup'.\n",
        "*   **ApplyLipstick:** This category also showed very good results, with 88% recall and perfect 100% precision, indicating it was very accurate when it predicted 'ApplyLipstick'.\n",
        "*   **Archery:** We saw a balanced performance for 'Archery', with 75% recall and 86% precision.\n",
        "*   **BabyCrawling:** For 'BabyCrawling', the model had 67% recall and 80% precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Confusion Matrix visually confirms these observations. We can see where the model might be confusing certain actions. For example, there's a slight confusion between 'ApplyLipstick' and 'ApplyEyeMakeup', and 'Archery' and 'BabyCrawling'. Overall, the Hybrid model demonstrates significant potential for this video classification task."
